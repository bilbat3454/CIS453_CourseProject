    CIS453L Course Project: Nature Boy Grooming
    
    Nature Boy Grooming offers top-quality grooming products for men that 
    cater to their needs. The product includes beard oils, balms, wash, conditioners, 
    and grooming tools like beard combs and brushes. They also provide lip balms, 
    bar soaps for face and body care, and various beanies and hats for headwear. 
    Additionally, they provide multiple services such as memberships, newsletter sign-ups, 
    and different forms of media.

    This webpage was created with React and utilizes single-page navigation to move 
    between the "About Us", "Products", and "Contact" sections. Custom components, 
    including imagery, the header with navigation, and buttons, were used to enhance 
    the design. The project underwent peer review and was updated as needed.
